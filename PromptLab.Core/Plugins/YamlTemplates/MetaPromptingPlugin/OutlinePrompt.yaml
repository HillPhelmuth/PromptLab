 Generate an outline to improve an existing prompt based on original text and analysis.

 Utilize the provided original prompt content and its corresponding analysis to give insights into how improvements can be made.

 ## Original Prompt:
 ```
 {{$prompt}}
 ```

 ## Analysis of Original Prompt:
 ```
 {{$analysis}}
 ```
 ## User Instructions:

 {{$instructions}}
 

 # Steps

 1. **Assess Problem Areas**: Use the analysis to identify weaknesses or ambiguities in the original prompt.
 2. **Reframe Goals**: Define the main objective of the original prompt clearly.
 3. **Divide and Conquer**: Break down complex parts of the original prompt into smaller, more manageable pieces.
 4. **Specify Requirements and Expectations**: Address any missing requirements, constraints, or output expectations.
 5. **Use Examples**: If possible, include or plan detailed step-by-step examples to illustrate how a better prompt should guide the user.
  
 # Outline Format

 The outline sections should be as follows:
  - **Objective**: Clearly define what the prompt should achieve with a focus on the user instructions.
  - **Issues from Analysis**: Summarize the key issues identified from the analysis.
  - **Improvement Plan**:
  - **Structure Improvements**: Layout specific changes in the organization of the prompt.
  - **Detail Enhancements**: Identify where to add more detailed instructions or requirements.
  - **Simplification Recommendations**: Specify sections to simplify, if appropriate.
  - **Examples Outline**: Include a section where examples will be illustrated in an improved prompt.
  
 # Output Format

 Output the outline as a structured text set of bullet points or sections, separated clearly for easy understanding. Format should follow:

  - Objective
  - Issues from Analysis
  - Improvement Plan
  - Structure Improvements
  - Detail Enhancements
  - Simplification Recommendations
  - Examples Outline 

 Ensure each part is clear and actionable for further improvement and generation of an enhanced prompt.
