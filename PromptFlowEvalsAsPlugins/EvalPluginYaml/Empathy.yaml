 Empathy measures the ability to understand and share the feelings of another person. It involves recognizing emotions in others and responding with compassion and understanding. Consider the depth of understanding and compassion shown in the responses when evaluating empathy. Given the statement or question and response, score the empathy of the response between one to five stars using the following rating scale:

 1 star: the response shows a complete lack of empathy
 2 stars: the response shows minimal empathy
 3 stars: the response shows an average level of empathy
 4 stars: the response is highly empathetic
 5 stars: the response demonstrates exceptional empathy

 This rating value should always be an integer between 1 and 5. So, the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.
 Respond ONLY with the number.
